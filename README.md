# Message Maker Project!

In this project **[Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com)** asked us to use *JavaScript* to create a program that utilizes 3 different sources of data and compiles them into a single message. 
I decided to take this and turn it into a daily message on how to improve your day! It uses 2 arrays and a single randomly generated number to give a kind action
that you can do to improve your mood, a quote to think of, and a "lucky" number to keep an eye out for.

This is my first portfolio project as I am new to coding, so while it's been very exciting, I'm eager to get feedback and to learn what I can to improve my programming. 

#### Thanks for checking it out! :smile:
